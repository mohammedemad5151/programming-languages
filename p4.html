C/C++ as an Internet language
Pros:
Speed and efficiency when large-scale computing is accomplished in a single HTTP transaction. (e.g., Google, Infoseek)
Cons:
Ease of writing code vulnerable to security attacks (particularly buffer overflows)
Although the most common buffer overflows are easily avoided by modern programmers who know better than to use gets/strcpy etc. It's a shame that not too many of these "modern programmers" seem to exist :( Yeah...well...but also there's just a lot of legacy code that seems to only get fixed one security alert at a time. :-(
It takes a lot of code & development time to get anything done in languages as low-level as this (in tradeoff for execution speed, sometimes) compared to some other options on this page.

Java as an Internet language
Pros:
Large commercial support base. Plenty of tools available, and manufacturers to go to for support
Large marketing department pushing it as "The" language for enterprise development
Application servers (J2EE, WebLogic) for scaleable web-based applications.
Has a decent "sandbox" model to reduce leaking control.
Cons:
High execution overhead for CGI.
Dedicated, large-footprint server for AppServer alternative
API designed primarily for divided-labor large-org architects rather than smaller-project end-users.
Lack of dynamic language features is not popular with many.

PHP as an Internet language
Pros
Can be embedded in HTML; seen as a dedicated web language.
Deceptively simple to learn.
Touted as a good beginner language.
Large array of built-in functions for everything from PDF creation to credit-card transactions to database interaction
Available at a majority of hosting services
Relatively good integration with apache.
Cons
While the runtime services are good, the language itself is quite horrible
Encourages writing bad code ^2 {too vague}'
PHP implementation is full of bugs and might change semantics without a note, causing constant security upgrades that break your code
What language doesn't have this problem (other than being so old that it doesn't need to change or used so rarely that hackers don't bother with it -- AKA "Mac syndrome".)
PHP encourages writing web programs in an insecure manner
Not too fast (good for building database interfaces, not making calculations)
